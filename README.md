## Project - Voting System

This smart contract provides the ability to register voters for a proposal ballot.
The owner of the contract has control over the registration period, is followed by the registration of proposals by registered voters.
Once there propsal registration is over, the vote begins.

A system of blockchain record has been created in order to keep track of the votes count.
There must be a winner as a result of the vote count: elected by highest vote count or by flip of coins; if 2 or more candidates have the same amount of votes different scenarios will be undertaken respectively for 2 candidates and for 3 or more.
